# Project Context — Shared Across All AI Agents

> **Canonical instructions file.** Claude, Gemini, Codex, Copilot, and any future
> AI tool all read THIS file. Tool-specific files (`CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`) exist
> only for their own protocol mechanics (MCP, context layering) and contain ZERO
> project context. **Edit shared rules HERE — never in the per-tool files.**

This project contains MuJoCo simulations for a tendon-driven underactuated finger:
an anthropomorphic 3-joint (MCP / PIP / DIP) model, plus a hardware-validation rig.

## User Preferences (MANDATORY)

- **Attribution — NO AI WATERMARKS.** All code, comments, and commit messages are
  attributed to the user (Namit Nair). Never add `Co-Authored-By` lines, "Generated
  with AI", or any mention of AI involvement anywhere — commits, code, or docs.
- **Stack:** Python (MuJoCo, NumPy, SciPy); XML/YAML for models.
- **Style:** Clean, documented, performance-oriented.

## Architecture & Source of Truth

- **Single Source of Truth:** `config.py` — all physical & numerical parameters
  (geometry, joint limits, tendon properties, spool radius, friction, etc.) live here.
  Notably `config.SPOOL_RADIUS = 0.011175 m` (measured Ø22.35 mm) is the one
  winding-radius constant used by both the hardware rig and the load-test ceiling.
- **Physics model:** `finger_model.py` — builds the MuJoCo model from `config.py`.
  Also provides `update_fixed_tendon_moment_arms()` which rewrites MuJoCo fixed-tendon
  wrap coefficients in-place every step, following the CAD-measured angle-dependent
  moment arm curve. No-op when `config.MOMENT_ARM_ANGLE_DEPENDENT` is False.
- **Analytical model:** `analytical_model.py` — closed-form morphology laws via
  energy minimization (incl. the angle-dependent tendon moment arm).
- **High-fidelity sim:** `high_fidelity/` — CAD-accurate geometry, interactive
  viewer, and validation suite. Results auto-write to `high_fidelity/validation_results/`.
  The validation loop calls `finger_model.update_fixed_tendon_moment_arms()` each step.
- **Paper table generation:** `high_fidelity/generate_tables.py` — generates Tables II/III/IV
  for the RAL 2026 publication from validation results.
- **Gripper load-test sim:** `gripper/` — the *simulated* two-finger pull-out rig
  (digital twin of the hardware load test). `interactive_load_test.py` is a single
  self-contained file that **builds** `load_test.xml` (git-ignored artifact) and
  opens a Tk dashboard; it is the source-of-truth XML builder + step physics.
  `stiffness_sweep.py` reuses that builder headlessly to (a) sweep a ρ1×ρ3
  stiffness-ratio grid → `sweep_results/heatmap_Tmax.png` + `stiffness_sweep.csv`,
  and (b) `--combos` mode → the 3 hardware spring sets as a Tmax bar chart
  (`load_test_combos_Tmax.png`). All geometry/friction/servo numbers come from
  `config.py` (`LOAD_TEST_*`, `FRICTION_MU_*`), so the sim tracks the real fixture.
- **Capstan load test:** `gripper/capstan/capstan_load_test.py` — self-contained
  load-test variant that wraps the tendon around a capstan spool for mechanical
  advantage. Includes a mu-sweep and stiffness-combo results pipeline.
- **Gripper geometry (hardware-faithful):** Each finger connects to a central
  mounting block through a 20×20×15 mm base link (`config.BASE_LINK_*`). The
  block (`config.GRIPPER_BLOCK_SIZE_MM = 30×120×30 mm`) sits behind the MCP
  joints and is drawn non-colliding. Object geoms carry duct-tape friction
  overrides (`config.GRIPPER_OBJECT_FRICTION`); finger phalanges use PLA
  friction (`config.FRICTION_MU_PLA = 0.4`, `config.FRICTION_MU_DUCTTAPE = 0.5`).
- **Hardware rig:** `hardware/` — PySide6 dashboard, Dynamixel servo, RealSense
  + ArUco joint-angle measurement. All three Dynamixels (finger A, B, pull)
  share one U2D2 serial bus (daisy-chained); `_ensure_bus()` opens it once.
- **Mocap rig:** `mocap/` — PhaseSpace (OWL2) optical tracking as an alternative
  joint-angle source. Self-contained: vendored `owl.py`, `tracker.py`
  (`PhaseSpaceTracker`/`MockTracker`), `dashboard.py` (subclasses the hardware
  `Dashboard`, reusing servo/logger/predictor/joints/auto-sweep verbatim),
  `calibrate.py`, and `mocap_config.py` (mocap-only knobs; physical params still
  come from root `config.py`). Results write to `mocap/results/`.
- **Archived mocap prototypes:** `motion capture test files/` — standalone test scripts
  predating the integrated `mocap/` directory. Not actively used; kept for reference.

When finger geometry or mechanics change, update **both** the high-fidelity model
**and** the analytical validation so they stay consistent.

## Key Technical Decisions (durable — read before touching the model)

- **Spool radius is unified:** `config.SPOOL_RADIUS = 0.011175 m` (measured Ø22.35 mm)
  is the single source for the servo ΔL↔revolutions mapping *and* the load-test force
  ceiling. The old guessed 10 mm / 12.5 mm values are gone — never reintroduce them.
- **Angle-dependent tendon moment arm:** the arm is NOT constant. It grows sub-linearly
  from **7 mm @ 0°** to **~10.25 mm @ 90°** (CAD-measured at 10° steps; saturates
  toward full flexion — not a straight line). `analytical_model.py` solves the
  resulting implicit equilibrium via a **Picard fixed-point** iteration over a
  PCHIP-interpolated curve. `finger_model.update_fixed_tendon_moment_arms()` makes
  MuJoCo track the same curve by rewriting fixed-tendon wrap_prm each step.
  Toggle with `config.MOMENT_ARM_ANGLE_DEPENDENT`; the constant-arm path is the
  documented fallback.
- **HW-validation analysis tool** (`high_fidelity/analyze_hw_validation.py`): picks a
  dataset by substring / path / latest; cleans data (drops ΔL=0, marker+PIP guards,
  per-ΔL MAD outlier rejection); reports M12/M32 agreement, angle error, repeatability,
  a per-ΔL table, and optional angle-dependent-arm recompute.
- **ArUco angle capture is averaged:** never trust a single frame — zeroing and capture
  average `N_AVG_SAMPLES` detections with a wrap-safe circular mean per marker.
- **RE-ZERO-theta feature was removed** from the dashboard; auto-sweep advances directly.
  Don't re-add it.
- **Load cell calibration is empirical, not a pure unit conversion.**
  `LOADCELL_SCALE = 22.20` (N per raw tared lbf unit) was derived from an
  origin-forced least-squares fit over 5 known-mass points. Re-derive it if the
  cable, connector, or USB220 module is replaced — the gain error is specific to
  the hardware chain. Force readouts are in kg (via `KGF_TO_N`), not lb.
- **Pull-out uses multi-peak detection with hysteresis**, not halt-on-first-drop.
  Pulling continues after a force drop; an arm → valley → re-arm cycle prevents
  one long slip from registering as many peaks. The capacity latches the largest
  peak across the entire pull; the operator halts manually.
- **Emergency shutdown on any exit.** `install_emergency_shutdown()` wires
  `atexit` + `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` handlers so Dynamixels are de-energised on
  Ctrl-C or kill, not just on GUI window close. Both dashboards use it.
- **PhaseSpace = labeled POINT markers, not rigid bodies.** Two LEDs per segment
  on four segments (base/prox/mid/dist). A per-segment rigid body is impossible
  here — the OWL SDK needs ≥4 markers for a 6-DOF body (`owl.py`), and we only
  need each segment's direction vector. `tracker.py` projects each 3D segment
  vector onto the flexion plane and reports a per-segment in-plane angle, so the
  existing `joints.py` differencing/zeroing is reused unchanged. The finger
  flexes in a FIXED horizontal plane (no abduction), so the plane normal is the
  lab vertical axis — set once via `MOCAP_VERTICAL_AXIS`/`MOCAP_VERTICAL_SIGN`,
  NO calibration flex. Only the normal affects joint angles (they difference
  consecutive segment angles → invariant to the in-plane long-axis reference,
  which is derived live from the stationary base markers). Residual marker
  pitch/yaw is removed by the projection + the straight-pose Set Zero.

> Live/evolving decisions beyond this list live in `CONTEXT.md` and the dual-graph

## Shared Memory — how to NOT forget across sessions

Memory is split into two layers. Use both.

1. **Live evolving memory → the dual-graph MCP store.** Whenever you make a
   decision, identify a task/next step, or hit a blocker, record it via
   `graph_add_memory(type=..., content="<15 words", tags=[...], files=[...])`.
   This is the real cross-session, cross-tool memory — any agent connected to the
   MCP reads it back. **Do NOT edit `context-store.json` by hand.**

2. **Rolling resume note → `CONTEXT.md`.** At session end (user says "bye/done/
   wrap up"), (re)write `CONTEXT.md` in the project root, under 20 lines:
   - **Current Task** (one sentence)
   - **Key Decisions** (≤3 bullets)
   - **Next Steps** (≤3 bullets)
   This is the fallback any tool can read even without the MCP. Read it FIRST.

> Tool-specific retrieval mechanics (dual-graph `graph_continue`, confidence caps,
> context layering) live in `CLAUDE.md` / `CODEX.md`. Those files contain NO
> project context — they exist only for protocol handshakes. All project knowledge
> comes from this file, `config.py`, and `CONTEXT.md`.
