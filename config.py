#    Two fingers extend along +X (horizontal), gripping an object that

#    ratio.

# Sized for the ~441 N/finger servo cap below, which holds ~200 N at the default
# grasp; raise this if a deeper/stronger grasp never fails within the slider range.

# Where along +X the object sits relative to the finger bases (set at build time;
# the panel has no live depth slider — depth defines the grasp TYPE, so relaunch
# to change it). This is the load test's OWN depth (separate from the static
# gripper's GRIPPER_OBJECT_DEPTH_Z): a deep/ENVELOPING grasp (~50 mm) wraps the
# object and holds a real pull-out load, whereas a shallow fingertip PINCH (~75+
# mm) resists by friction alone and slips almost immediately. The object must
# still FIT the aperture: aperture/2 - 0.013 >= radius, else the fingers start
# embedded in it and contact forces explode.
LOAD_TEST_OBJECT_DEPTH_X = 0.050        # m — default: an enveloping grasp that holds

# ---- Actuator force limit (the "infinite grip" fix) -------------------------
# A ΔL-displacement tendon is a near-rigid spring (TENDON_STIFFNESS ≈ 1e5 N/m),
# so a finger blocked by the object resists with essentially UNBOUNDED force —
# the grip would be "infinitely strong" and no external load could ever pull the
# object out. A real tendon actuator (servo + string) can only output a finite
# force. We cap the flexor tension at this ceiling (see
# interactive_load_test.capped_lengthspring); once the pull T exceeds what the
# capped grip can hold, the object slips and slides to the LOAD_TEST_SLIDE_RANGE end.
#
# The ceiling comes from the servo, which winds the tendon onto a spool of radius
# LOAD_TEST_SPOOL_RADIUS:  tendon tension = servo_torque / spool_radius.
# One servo per finger, so each flexor gets the full stall torque.
#   Dynamixel XM430-W350-T: ~45 kgf·cm ≈ 4.41 N·m stall (max output).
#   r_spool = 10 mm  →  F_max ≈ 441 N per finger.

LOAD_TEST_MAX_TENDON_FORCE = LOAD_TEST_SERVO_STALL_TORQUE / LOAD_TEST_SPOOL_RADIUS  # N — per-finger flexor force ceiling
LOAD_TEST_MAX_FORCE_UI_MAX = 600.0      # N — upper bound of the live "F max" slider
