# Where along +X the object sits relative to the finger bases (set at build time;
# the panel has no live depth slider — depth defines the grasp TYPE, so relaunch
# to change it). This is the load test's OWN depth (separate from the static
# gripper's GRIPPER_OBJECT_DEPTH_Z): a deep/ENVELOPING grasp (~50 mm) wraps the
# object and holds a real pull-out load, whereas a shallow fingertip PINCH (~75+
# mm) resists by friction alone and slips almost immediately. The object must

# ---- Actuator force limit (the "infinite grip" fix) -------------------------
# A ΔL-displacement tendon is a near-rigid spring (TENDON_STIFFNESS ≈ 1e5 N/m),
# so a finger blocked by the object resists with essentially UNBOUNDED force —
# the grip would be "infinitely strong" and no external load could ever pull the
# object out. A real tendon actuator (servo + string) can only output a finite
# force. We cap the flexor tension at this ceiling (see
# interactive_load_test.capped_lengthspring); once the pull T exceeds what the
# capped grip can hold, the object slips and slides to the LOAD_TEST_SLIDE_RANGE end.
