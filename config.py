# the panel has no live depth slider — depth defines the grasp TYPE, so relaunch
# to change it). This is the load test's OWN depth (separate from the static
# gripper's GRIPPER_OBJECT_DEPTH_Z): a deep/ENVELOPING grasp (~50 mm) wraps the
# object and holds a real pull-out load, whereas a shallow fingertip PINCH (~75+

# so a finger blocked by the object resists with essentially UNBOUNDED force —
# the grip would be "infinitely strong" and no external load could ever pull the
# object out. A real tendon actuator (servo + string) can only output a finite
# force. We cap the flexor tension at this ceiling (see
# interactive_load_test.capped_lengthspring); once the pull T exceeds what the
# capped grip can hold, the object slips and slides to the LOAD_TEST_SLIDE_RANGE end.

# 10. TENDON-SHEATH & PIN FRICTION  —  high_fidelity/chaos_study.py
# =====================================================================
# The ideal fidelity model is frictionless: every joint feels the SAME tendon
# tension, so a zero-stiffness closure is a near-simultaneous dead heat. Real
# hardware is not — and two GROUNDED, MEASURABLE friction sources break that
# symmetry. They are the leading candidate for the non-repeatable hardware close.
#
#   (a) CAPSTAN (tendon-in-sheath) friction.  Where the tendon wraps each joint
#       it loses tension by the capstan law  T_out = T_in · e^(-mu·Phi), with
#       Phi = wrap angle at that joint (≈ the joint's own flexion + a small
#       resting routing wrap). Tension is therefore HIGHEST at the actuator
#       (proximal/MCP) and WEAKEST at the tip (distal/DIP): distal joints are
#       under-driven, and the deficit grows with curl. Modelled as an opposing
#       joint torque  ARM · T · (1 - e^(-mu·Phi_upstream))  folded into
#       dof_frictionloss (so it is strictly dissipative).
#       PROVENANCE of mu (the only genuinely new number):
#         * direct two-end test — clamp the joints rigid, drive the tendon with
#           the servo, read the far-end tension on the Futek load cell; regress
#           ln(T_in/T_out) against total wrap ΣPhi → slope = mu (offset-free).
#         * sanity band by material pair: PTFE/Teflon-lined sheath + steel cable
#           mu≈0.04-0.10; bare nylon/Delrin mu≈0.15-0.25; bare metal mu≈0.2-0.4.
#       The wrap angles Phi are GEOMETRY (joint angles + routing), NOT free knobs.
#
#   (b) PIN (hinge) Coulomb friction.  Even with pins, each hinge has a dry
#       breakaway torque tau_c. Modelled directly as MuJoCo dof_frictionloss.
#       PROVENANCE: per-joint breakaway test (tendon detached) — hang a known
#       mass at a known moment arm, raise until the joint just rotates,
#       tau_c = m·g·L. Equivalently the half-width of the torque-angle hysteresis
#       loop when driving the bare joint slowly back and forth.
#
# RIGOROUS TIE-DOWN (so these are not tuned in a vacuum): fit (mu, tau_c) so the
# SIMULATED ΔL→tendon-tension hysteresis loop matches the MEASURED one (load then
# unload the tendon over the full ΔL, logging servo-side tension vs ΔL). The loop
# WIDTH is set by total friction; the distal CURL SKEW by the capstan gradient —
# fitting both uses the friction's entire observable footprint, not one point.
# Then report the chaos result as a BAND over FRICTION_MU_SWEEP, carrying the
# measurement uncertainty into the conclusion instead of trusting a single value.
