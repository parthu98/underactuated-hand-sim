"""Mocap-rig-only configuration (PhaseSpace finger tracking).

Kept SEPARATE from the repo's root ``config.py`` on purpose: the root config is
the single source of truth for the *physical* finger (geometry, joint limits,
spring stiffnesses, spool radius, moment arms) and is consumed by the analytical
model + the hardware servo. This file holds ONLY mocap-specific knobs — the
PhaseSpace server address, which LED ids belong to which finger segment, and
where calibration / results live. Nothing here changes the physics.

Marker layout (decided with the user)
-------------------------------------
Two LED markers per segment, on FOUR segments — base/palm, proximal, middle,
distal (8 LEDs total). Each segment's direction vector is ``p_far - p_near``;
the joint angle is the in-plane angle between consecutive segment vectors, which
two points give directly (no rigid body needed — the OWL SDK requires >=4
markers for a rigid body, and we only need a direction).

``MOCAP_SEGMENT_MARKER_IDS`` is ordered ``[base, proximal, middle, distal]``;
each entry is ``(near_id, far_id)`` where ``near`` is the LED nearer the palm and
``far`` is the LED nearer the fingertip, so ``far - near`` points distally along
the finger. EDIT these to match the LED ids you assigned in the PhaseSpace
Master Client.

# --- flexion-plane definition -----------------------------------------------
# The finger flexes in a FIXED plane (no abduction), so the flexion plane is the
# horizontal plane and its normal is simply the lab VERTICAL axis. We define the
# plane from that known normal — no calibration flex, no extra marker needed. The
# projection then strips every bit of out-of-plane marker tilt/rotation, and the
# straight-pose Set Zero cancels the residual constant in-plane offsets.
#
# Only the NORMAL affects joint angles (they are differences of consecutive
# segment angles, which are invariant to the in-plane long-axis reference). So
# the single thing to get right is which axis points up.
#
# CHECK THIS LIVE: lift a marker off the table and watch which coordinate grows.
